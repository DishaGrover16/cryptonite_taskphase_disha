**HELLO HACKERS**

***1.Intro to Commands***

In order to complete this challenge, "hello" command was required to be executed. This command gave the flag required as an output.

``` 
Connected!
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ whoami
hacker
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{YkroVw7CVlDHQAYBwjzirqhm6Ay.ddjNyUDLwQDO0czW}
```

***2.Intro to Arguments***

As we are taught that the first word is the command, and the subsequent words are arguments. The task was to run hello command with a single argument of hackers. 
Thus writing 'hello hackers' gave the flag.
```
Connected!
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{INw0PYSewFRDeuyh1mJcNzeF-_V.dhjNyUDLwQDO0czW}
```
