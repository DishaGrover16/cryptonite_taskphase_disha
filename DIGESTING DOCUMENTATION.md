**DIGESTING DOCUMENTATION**

***1.Learning from Documentation***

We have to use the ```/challenge/challenge``` command with the ```--giveflag``` argument to get the flag
```
Connected!
hacker@man~learning-from-documentation:~$ /challenge/challenge --giveflag
Correct argument! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{k9FBHS2sPF8Kd0Q8A9DusD4_P_X.dRjM5QDLwQDO0czW}
```

***2.Learning Complex Usage***

With the ```--printfile``` arugment we can print arbitrary files to the terminal.The argument to the --printfile argument is the path of the flag to read. Thus using this I got the flag. 

```
Connected!
hacker@man~learning-complex-usage:~$ /challenge/challenge --printfile /flag
Correct argument! Here is the /flag file:
pwn.college{EB8mD29kwDJ7psG23WVDbEr7GyL.dVjM5QDLwQDO0czW}
```

***3.Reading Manuals***

As we know that man command will display (if available) the manual of the command you pass as an argument, thus I implemented ```man challenge``` command to print the manual of challenge. On reading that I found the way to flag.

```

hacker@man~reading-manuals:~$ man challenge

hacker@man~reading-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --ldlvhe 064
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{A0H6ldlFvWXhegkyqLH4MKQJdSO.dRTM4QDLwQDO0czW}
```

***4.Searching Manuals***

First I opened the challenge manual and using ```/flag``` I started the search. I used n to skip down to the next result and this way found an argument ```--rqt``` which gave me the flag.

```

hacker@man~searching-manuals:~$ man challenge
hacker@man~searching-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --rqt
Initializing...
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{k5yZIeuCb7f9D9H50UCOHhTn5i3.dVTM4QDLwQDO0czW}
```

***5.Searching for Manuals***

To search for the right man page, I used the command ```man man``` . On reading the manual, -k flag argument is discovered which could contain the required term. Further, to print the flag we find ```kpbukywdnx``` in the manual. At the end on using ```man kpbukywdnx``` we get the required argument to print the flag.

MAN(1)                                                  Manual pager utils                                                 MAN(1)

NAME
       man - an interface to the system reference manuals

SYNOPSIS
       man [man options] [[section] page ...] ...
       man -k [apropos options] regexp ...
       man -K [man options] [section] term ...
       man -f [whatis options] page ...
       man -l [man options] file ...
       man -w|-W [man options] page ...

DESCRIPTION
       man is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.
       The manual page associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will  direct
       man  to look only in that section of the manual.  The default action is to search in all of the available sections follow‚Äê
       ing a pre-defined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found, even if page exists in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional section names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE, ERRORS,
       ENVIRONMENT, FILES, VERSIONS, CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.
